 👋 Hi, I’m orion. 

sigh. it's kind of crazy that i knew this was my calling, but i decided to do a health related course, because i hated math.

three years in now, studying a course that i might never get a real job with (except working with Opay lmfao). 

still can't believe a lecturer actually told me this.

anyways, i've changed paths, knowing fully well i'll have to juggle Biochemistry and coding, somehow. but why not? after all, i'm human, and other humans have done this too.

that's my situation in a nutshell. 

i'm sure y'all will enjoy my projects, as i actually want to enter into ethical and black hat hacking. 

you can send an email to 
andrew.orion9@gmail.com if you have questions, or you can just update the issues tab lol.

thank you.🫵🏾
